[Getting started with WPGraphQL and Gridsome](https://www.wpgraphql.com/2021/03/16/getting-started-with-wpgraphql-and-gridsome)

## Install

The very first thing is to install the Gridsome CLI

```shell
npm install --global @gridsome/cli
```

Navigate to your desired project folder and type in

```shell
gridsome create my-personal-site https://github.com/nicolaisimonsen/wpgraphql-gridsome-starter-stripped.git
```

or if youâ€™re starting from scratch

```shell
gridsome create my-personal-site
```

Now move into the project directory â€“ then start the local develoment

```shell
cd my-personal-site
```

```shell
gridsome develop
```
